#  Tangentially-driven active polymer
Tangentially-driven by active force, active polymers are prone to [collapse](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.097801) in closed topology (unknotted ring).

## Note:
You will be able to observe onset of collapse after 1e7 time steps. The collapsed configuration is irreversible. *I encourage you to run for really large Pe number.*
