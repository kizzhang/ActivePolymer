# Chiral active Brownian polymer
Chirality can be introduced into active Brownian particles. See this comprehensive [paper](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.94.062120) by Sevilla. Chiral ABPs can also be chained to form a polymer.

# Note:
Here is a benchmark of changing Peclet number by fixing the magnitude of the torque $\tau_0 = 100$ pointing in $(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}})$.
